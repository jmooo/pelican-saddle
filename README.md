Subtle Pelican Theme
====================

[pelican-subtle](https://github.com/pR0Ps/pelican-subtle) is a responsive theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), it is my take on Giulio Fidente's [pelican-svbhack](https://github.com/giulivo/pelican-svbhack) theme.

## Demo

You can see the theme in action on [my site](http://cmetcalfe.ca/) ([site source code](https://github.com/pR0Ps/website)).

## Features

- Clean, responsive design. Scales to fit any screen
- Fully HTML5 compliant
- Fully usable without Javascript (although enabling it adds more functionality)
- Ability to hide email addresses from spambots
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Integrated Google Analytics
- Custom sidebar links and social icons
- Fuzzy date display (ex: "Posted 2 days ago") using Javascript
- Disqus comment integration
- Automatically minifies and compresses Javascript and CSS

## Dependencies

For automatic minification and compression of assets, this theme uses the
[webassets](https://webassets.readthedocs.org/) package, along with `cssmin` for minifying css,
`slimit` for compressing Javascript, and `libsass` for compiling the
[SCSS](http://www.sass-lang.com) styles. The pelican integration of all this is handled by the
[webassets pelican plugin](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/webassets)

## Installing

1. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/pR0Ps/pelican-subtle)
2. Install and configure the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add `"webassets"` to the `PLUGINS` variable in `pelicanconf.py`.
3. Modify the `THEME` variable in `pelicanconf.py` to point to the cloned theme location
4. Customize the theme using the options below

## pelicanconf.py

When developing locally, you may want to set `SITEURL` to something like `http://localhost:8000`

This theme supports a number of custom variables:

- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`: Your Google Analytics UA-XXXXXXXX-X code (`None` to disable analytics).
- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PROP`: Your Google Analytics property name (`None` to disable analytics).
- `DISPLAY_META_ABOVE_ARTICLE`: Set to `True` to display article information above the article (default is below).
- `DISQUS_SITENAME`: Set this to enable Disqus comments on articles.
- `DISQUS_COLLAPSED`: Set to `True` to have article comments hidden by default. Clicking a link on the page will load them.
- `USER_LOGO_URL`: The image to display as the profile image. Can be local or a remote URL.
- `TAGLINE`: The site's tagline. Rendered right below the user image.
- `MANGLE_EMAILS`: If enabled, any emails in the `SOCIAL` or `LINKS` lists will be obfuscated in HTML and have their links generated by Javascript when the page loads.
- `GLOBAL_KEYWORDS`: A list of strings that will be set as meta keywords for each page.
- `RELATIVE_DATES`: If `True`, will add relative times to various dates (eg. 'Posted 3 months ago on [date]').
